# Unusual Test Cases with Cypress

This project contains implemented tests covering unusual test cases from [The Internet](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/). The tests are designed to explore edge cases on the platform, focusing on specific scenarios that may not be commonly encountered.

The test cases are simple and do not rely on models or additional setups, making them easy to execute and modify.

## How to Run

To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

2. Open Cypress:

    ```
    npx cypress open
    ```

3. Choose the browser (e.g., Electron or Chrome) and run the tests. The test cases will automatically appear in the Cypress interface.
